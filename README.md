# Welcome

This is the core-software respository for [sPHENIX collaboration](https://www.sphenix.bnl.gov/). 

Code from the `mastrer` branch is pulled and build each night (nightly-build) 
and it becomes [part of the default software environment on RCF](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/Setup#.28At_each_login.29_Run_sPHENIX_login_shell). 
Weekly snapshot of the build is also available as ANA-builds. 
Due to its importance, update of this repository require going through a review via [the "Pull Request" process](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/GitHub_Coresoftware_Update_Procedures). 

Updates to this repository requires [submitting a "GitHub Pull Request"](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/GitHub_Coresoftware_Update_Procedures).
New pull requests may be released to be automatically checked with the [sPHENIX Jenkins continuous integration](https://web.racf.bnl.gov/jenkins-sphenix/). At the end of the check, a report will be posted back to the corresponding pull request thread.
