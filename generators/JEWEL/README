The manual with information on how to run JEWEL is distributed with the JEWEL 
release and can be obtained from
..................

If you use this code for scientific work please cite the manual for the code and
JHEP 1303 (2013) 080 [arXiv:1212.1599] and optionally EPJC C60 (2009) 617 
[arXiv:0804.3568] for the physics.


2. GETTING STARTED
------------------

JEWEL needs LHAPDF to provide the PDF's. Install LHAPDF following the instructions 
on the LHAPDF web page (lhapdf.hepforge.org) and download the PDF sets you want to 
use. In its default setup JEWEL needs the CTEPQ6LL (number 10042) and EPS09LOR_208 
sets. The latter can be downloaded from the EPS09 web page (www.jyu.fi/fysiikka/en/
research/highenergy/urhic/eps09).

The provided Makefile assumes that JEWEL will be compiled with gfortran. People who 
wish to use a different compiler have to modify the Makefile accordingly.

Download and unpack the tarball. 
$ tar xvzf jewel-2.0.0.tar.gz
Edit the line 
LHAPDF_PATH := /path/to/lhapdf 
in the Makefile to point to your LHAPDF installation.
Compile the code by typing 'make'. The result of this are two executables: 
jewel-2.0.0-vac and jewel-2.0.0-simple. The former simulates jet evolution in vacuum 
(i.e. in e-e+ or pp collisions) while the latter simulates jet evolution in the 
presence of a medium. In this case the medium is modelled by an ideal gas of quarks and 
gluons undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal expansion with a transverse profile derived 
from a Glauber model.

The following paths need to be set for JEWEL to run: 
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lhapdf/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export LHAPATH=/path/to/lhapdf/share/lhapdf/PDFsets
To run JEWEL with the default setting no parameter file is needed: 
$./jewel-2.0.0-simple 
or 
$./jewel-2.0.0-vac 
Note, however, that also in the latter case nuclear PDF's will be used.

A parameter file can to be passed to change the setting: 
$./jewel-2.0.0-simple params.example.dat 
The file params.example.dat is included in the tarball as an example for a parameter file. The 
file can contain one parameter per line, the format is <name>␣<value>. Lines starting with a hash 
are comment lines. For a list of parameters and their dafault values please refer to the manual.


3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
-------------------

JEWEL relies heavily on PYTHIA 6 (pythia6.hepforge.org) for the event generation. The modified 
version of PYTHIA 6.4.25 that is distributed with JEWEL is, however, not an official PYTHIA 
release and must not be used for anything else. Please refer to results as "JEWEL+PYTHIA".

JEWEL contains code provided by S. Zhang and J. M. Jing  (Computation of Special Functions,
John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1996 and http://jin.ece.illinois.edu) for computing the exponential 
integral Ei(x).

The medium model was partly implemented by Jochen Klein [Jochen.Klein@cern.ch].
Raghav Kunnawalkam Elayavalli helped with the implementation of the V+jet processes [raghav.k.e@cern.ch].

The JEWEL code is provided without any warranty, users should be wary and use common
sense when judging and interpreting their results. It is copyrighted but may be used for
scientiﬁc work provided proper reference is given.
