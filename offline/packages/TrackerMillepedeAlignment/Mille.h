/**
 * \class Mille
 *
 *  Class to write a C binary (cf. below) file of a given name and to fill it
 *  with information used as input to **pede**.
 *  Use its member functions \c mille(), \c special(), \c kill() and \c end()
 *  as you would use the fortran \ref mille.f90 "MILLE"
 *  and its entry points \c MILLSP, \c KILLE and \c ENDLE.
 *
 *  For debugging purposes constructor flags enable switching to text output and/or
 *  to write also derivatives and labels which are ==0.
 *  But note that **pede** will not be able to read text output and has not been tested with
 *  derivatives/labels ==0.
