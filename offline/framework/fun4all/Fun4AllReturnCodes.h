// In general negative return codes signal some fatal condition where continuing is just a waste of cpu

// SubsysReco module return codes:
// ABORTRUN: signals that processing should be aborted for this run, the process will exit with a non zero exit
// ABORTEVENT: abort reconstruction of the current event, reset everything and process the next event
// EVENT_OK: generic good return
// DISCARDEVENT: tell a connected output manager not to save this event but continue processing
// DONOTREGISTERSUBSYSTEM: during registration, module indicates it doesn't want to be registered

// Synchronization
// SYNC_OK: all good
// SYNC_FAIL: synchronization failed (leads to a search for matching events by the sync manager)
// SYNC_NOOBJECT: no synchronization object in this input manager, take current event without check
// RESET_NODE_TREE: internal use - under certain conditions during the synchronization process Fun4All needs to reset the node tree to clear the prvious event
