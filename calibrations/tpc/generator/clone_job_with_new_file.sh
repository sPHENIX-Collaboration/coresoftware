# This shell script follows the pattern of the valid sample job, with some hints
# about what parts are what, and generates a job by bXing number for all other
# source files in the provided filelist.
# If you are changing the format of the filename, you may need to alter the code
# so that it continues to extract and replace the correct items.
#
# in: (hardcoded) example file, hints about what to replace, and filelist
# out: set of job_NNNNN.job files, each of which can be submitted to condor.
