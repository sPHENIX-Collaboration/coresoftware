2015-03-27  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Reduce/add HepMCDefs.h and SimpleVector.h to stubs for backward
	compatibility, which include the modern equivalent headers and
	produce preprocessor warnings. These should be conditionally
	installed only when building in compatibility mode.

	* Adding, removing, and tweaking feature detection macros.

	* Adding backward compatibility typedefs to CrossSection,
	HeavyIon, PdfInfo (i.e. without the Gen prefixes)

2015-03-26  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Overhaul of FourVector class and removal of FourVector.icc

	* Differentiate between SmartPointer const and non-const
	dereferencing and arrow operators, to pass on the constness
	semantics to the contained type. This blocks accidents like
	calling non-const modifying functions on a const GenVertexPtr or
	const GenParticlePtr, which is not protected against by
	e.g. shared_ptr<GenParticle>. Plus adding an operator for bool
	comparisons to SmartPointer and (many) updates through the main
	object classes to respect the newly invigorated constness
	rules. Good!

	* Changing GenEvent::event_pos() to return a FourVector ref rather
	than the root vertex itself, and changing
	GenEvent::offset_event(v) to two explicitly named
	shift_event_by(v) and shift_event_to(v) methods.
