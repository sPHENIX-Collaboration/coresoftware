# PTO3P replaces the D_DALITZ model
# D+ -> anti-K0 pi+ pi0 with 3 channels contributing to the final state
#
# Note that EvtResonance used the CLEO amplitude specification
# in which the sign was flipped. (The amplitude was proportional 
# to -cosTh(BC) in the r.f. of AB). I've flipped the sign back,
# therefore the angle is calculated between a different pair of particles.
