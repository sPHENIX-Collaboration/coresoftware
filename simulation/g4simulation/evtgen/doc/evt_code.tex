\section{Guidelines for coding in EvtGen}
\label{sect:codestd}
\index{Nameing convention}

This section is included for the convenience of the
developers to make clear how classes, memeber functions
etc. should be named. Note that a lot of the original code 
was written completely without any of these guidelines
and hence are in complete violation of this guide. It is,
however, a goal of the developers to modify the old code 
to be consistent with this standard.

All classes, and in general any global symbols, should
start with the three letters ``Evt''. This is the package TLA
as used in BaBar. Further class names are written using
capital letters for the first letter in each word that makes
up the name, e.g., EvtDecayTable.

Member functions start with a lower case letter and further words
in the name are written with the first letter in capital, e.g., 
getDecayModel() is then the way a member function that 
returns the decay model should be named.

Memeber data starts with an underscore, \_, and \_decaymodel
is then how a the member data that stores the decay models 
should be named. 

Note in particular that it is discouraged to use an underscore
in the name of either classes, member functions, or member data
to separate words.
