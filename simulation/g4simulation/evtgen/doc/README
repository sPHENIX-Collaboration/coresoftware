 README file for documentation of EvtGen.

To generate the guide.ps run "do_latex" it runs the set of commands needed 
to produce the postscript file.

Alternatively in the BaBar srt structure you can do "gmake EvtGen.guide"
which puts the output (guide.ps as well as HTML) in doc/guide/EvtGen/.

 The EvtGen documentation is keept in the doc subdirectory 
of the EvtGen package.
 
 It is a latex document consisting of the following files:

  guide.tex              Main tex file.

  guide.bib              The bibliography.

  do_latex               script to generate the guide.ps file.

  evt_algorithm.tex      Describes the algorithm.

  evt_classes.tex        Description of classes.

  evt_conventions.tex    Physics conventions.

  evt_cpviolation.tex    Describes how CP violation and mixing is
                         implemented.

  evt_decayamp.tex       Describes how to write down decay amplitudes.

  evt_decaytable.tex     Describes how the decay table in EvtGen works.

  evt_examples.tex       Gives examples of how to run EvtGen.

  evt_finalstaterad.tex  How PHOTOS is used for generation of final state radiation.     

  evt_helamp.tex         Definition of how helicity amplitudes are used.

  evt_intro.tex          The introduction.

  evt_jetset.tex         Defines the jetset interface.

  evt_macro.tex          Contains some definitions that are
                         used throughout the document.

  evt_models.tex         Description of the available decay models.

  evt_monitoring.tex     Describes switches that can be turned on to get a summary
                         of how the generator worked.

  evt_util.tex           Describes various utility functions.

  evt_wrtmodel.tex       Describes how to implement a decay model.
