Broadly speaking there are two different categories of
optimization. The firt type concerns just making the code
more efficient, i.e., there are no changes to the algorithm.
A very simple example of such optimization is the order in 
which operations are performed, let a be a double and p and k 
four-vectors.
\begin{verbatim}
   a*(p*k);
\end{verbatim}
is more efficient then 
\begin{verbatim}
   (a*p)*k;
\end{verbatim}
